I was working in the tech support industry when I decided to switch my career and joined AltCampus. 

Each day, mentors pick a topic and explain it in layman's terms. They focus heavily on having you practice, which is what sets them apart from others.

The mentors are always there to help with anything you need with regards to interview preps and job search.






 

I'd recommend AltCampus to anyone who wants to learn web/software development.
