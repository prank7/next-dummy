        Refund Policy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The information provided below will help a User to understand our refund
        deadlines and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A User, who has not in the past 7 days availed the Free Trial, shall be
        entitled to a refund of 90% (ninety percent) of the course fee paid upon
        a valid refund request raised within 7(seven) days from the date of
        payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        A User who has availed a Free Trial as specified in the
        <a href="/pricing-policy">Pricing Policy</a>, any time during the
        preceding 7 days, shall not be entitled to any refund. It is clarified
        that if any User makes payment during the subsistence of the Free Trial
        Window, such User shall not be entitled to any refund. AltCampus
        reserves the right to reject a refund request if in its view the User
        has not furnished any reason for seeking a refund or has not furnished
        any valid refund request.
      </p>

      <p>
        The refund request shall be raised in the form and manner specified in
        this refund policy (‘Specified Manner’). Any refund request not raised
        in the Specified Manner shall be treated as null and void and AltCampus
        shall at its sole discretion be entitled to proceed or not proceed with
        such refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        In respect of this refund policy, the Specified Manner shall mean the
        refund request raised by the User by sending an email with subject
        matter “Refund Request” to hello@altcampus.io, specifying the User Name,
        the course details, the date of payment and the reason for seeking
        refund. AltCampus shall refund the money to the original payment method,
        at its discretion, depending on the policies of AltCampus’s payment
        processing partners, the platform through which the course was purchased
        (Website), and other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as specified in this Refund Policy, AltCampus shall not be
        obligated to provide refund to the Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing and unless explicitly stated otherwise, if
        a purchase is made by a User through third party marketplace (e.g.
        purchase made through alternative payment services or through Google
        play store or Apple App store or any third party educational course
        marketplace) (‘Third Party Marketplace’), the terms and conditions and
        the refund policy applicable to such Third Party Marketplace shall
        apply. The refund process shall be governed by the refund policies of
        such Third Party Marketplace and such Third Party Marketplace shall be
        solely responsible for making such refunds. AltCampus hereby disclaims
        all responsibilities or liabilities arising out of such Third Party
        Marketplace’s refund policy or the third party’s compliance or
        non-compliance with its refund policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that AltCampus views and treats violations of its Terms of
        Use very seriously and shall have no obligation to offer refunds to
        Users who violate such terms, even if the refund request is made within
        the designated refund period as specified above.
